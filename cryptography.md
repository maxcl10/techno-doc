# Cryptography

## Symmetric Key

Algorithm that uses the `same key to encrypt and decrypt`. The key is a shared secret between the parties. (AES, DES).

## Asymmetric Keys

System that uses pairs of Keys. `Public key and private key`. A message is encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted by the owner of the private key (RSA).

## PKI

Stands for **Public Key Infrastructure**.

## Hash function

Any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to a fixed size value (MD5, SHA-1).
